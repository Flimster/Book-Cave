# Book-Cave

This project allows the user do to various things, such as buy a book, create an account and edit his account

The user can search for a book through the search engine at the top of the page
There he can filter by various means, such as genre, price range, language and author

The user can also create an account and login and log out
There he can edit his name, edit his email and change his profile picture
He can also see his past orders, wish list, and bookshelf
He can also add payment methods, billing addresses and shipping addresses

The user can also buy books by selecting the Cart icon in the top left cornert of the screen, below the Account button
There he can go through various screens to select his shipping, billing and payment which he created in his account

Do note that the functions and UI (incomplete) for the Admin exist but there was simply not enough time to connect the two together
